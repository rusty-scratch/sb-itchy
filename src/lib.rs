//! Hello there!
//! Nothing much here be here are some note when building:
//!  - Scratch won't load if there are layer order collision; make sure all your Sprite have different layer order; Stage should be 0.
//!  - Scratch also won't load if there are no costume in Sprite or Stage; make sure to have atleast one!
//!
//! More documentation will made later if a lot of people actually uses this crate.
//!
//! Feel free to ask in github discussion. I will make sure to answer all of you questions if no one do so!
